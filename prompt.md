>
> 2. **Product Management**
>    - CRUD for products (admin only)
>    - Product listing with pagination and filtering (category, price, rating)
>    - Product detail pages with reviews and average ratings
>
> 3. **Shopping Cart & Wishlist**
>    - Add, update, and remove items from cart
>    - Wishlist functionality
>    - Persistent cart using Django sessions or localStorage
>
